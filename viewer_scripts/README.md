Create the following files somewhere in your $PATH:

`bitlibVideoPlayer`
`bitlibImageViewer`
`bitlibGifViewer`

These are shell scripts that redirect to viewing apps of your choice.

You can use the supplied scripts, editing them to correctly launch the apps that you would like to use.

Notes: mpv is a video player with a minimal ui and the best looking looping I've seen, so that's what I use. Easy to install on Linux. You can get if for MacOS here:

https://mpv.io/installation/

MacOS won't want to run it because it's untrusted, but you can go into security settings and choose to let it run.
